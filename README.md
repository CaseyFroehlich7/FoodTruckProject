# FoodTruckProject

## Overview:
The Food Truck program is designed to accept user input on their food truck festival experience. The idea behind this program is that the user can input the names of the food trucks, the type of food they served, and their personal rating of the food. Once their data has been entered, a menu is displayed to the user where they can choose how they would like that data to be processed and displayed. At that point the user can navigate through the menu provided to access information such as; a full list of food trucks, the average ratings of all food trucks, or the highest rated food truck. 

### How It Works:
The user is first welcomed to the food truck festival. They are then prompted to enter the name of the food truck, the type of food they served, and what rating they would give that specific food truck. The information they provide is taken and stored in an array where each truck is assigned its own unique truck identification number. Once the information is obtained, the program presents a festival menu where the user is able to view a full list of all food trucks, the average rating of all food trucks, the highest rated food truck, or quit the program. The menu will continue to be displayed until the user decides to quit. 

## Lessons Learned:
Working through this project was great for me on my road to becoming a developer. First and foremost, creating a blueprint or an outline before diving into something can save you hours. When dealing with a project that has multiple moving parts, I quickly realized that I had actually created a mess and wasted more time than I would've liked. This was a lesson in itself as I took a step back, created a plan, and even thought of other ways I could complete a task. 

Secondly, I believe as I learn and understand concepts on a deeper level I was able to google more efficiently and find information that benefited me during this project. During this project I became more familiar with Stack Overflow and give it credit for most of my google results. Becoming more familiar with this site and what I'm looking for really helped. Examples of things I found on Stack Overflow include; 
1. More information on and how to implement system.out.printf(); to make sure my ratings didn't have long decimals. 
2. Finding more information on for loops, switches, arrays and constructors
3. I worked through the java.lang.exception error by simply googling it and that lead me to an Oracle site which after some reading I noticed that what I was missing in my code was "null". 

Lastly, as my program was coming together and things are being moved around I found it was easy for simple mistakes to happen. When I fixed the null pointer exception error and completed the rest of my project I found that I still had issues that were simple human error. Paying more attention to the little things can save a lot of time.
